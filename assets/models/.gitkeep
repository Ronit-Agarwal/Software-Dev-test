# ASL ML Models

This directory contains the TFLite models for ASL sign recognition.

## Required Models

### 1. asl_cnn.tflite (Required for Static ASL Sign Recognition)

- **Architecture**: ResNet-50 CNN with FP16 quantization
- **Input**: 224x224x3 RGB images
- **Output**: 27 classes (26 letters A-Z + UNKNOWN)
- **File Size**: ~100-150 MB

### 2. asl_lstm.tflite (Optional, for Dynamic Sign Recognition)

- **Architecture**: LSTM for temporal sequence modeling
- **Input**: Sequence of CNN features
- **Output**: Multi-sign word recognition

### 3. yolov11.tflite (Optional, for Object Detection)

- **Architecture**: YOLO v11
- **Input**: 640x640 RGB images
- **Output**: Object bounding boxes and classes

## How to Add Models

1. Convert your trained models to TFLite format (see `docs/MODEL_SETUP.md`)
2. Place the `.tflite` files in this directory
3. Ensure the models are listed in `pubspec.yaml` under `flutter.assets`

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/models/
```

## Model Placeholder

The app includes placeholder logic for missing models. When models are missing:

- The app will attempt to load the model on first use (lazy loading)
- If the model file doesn't exist, appropriate error messages will be shown
- The app will still function for other features (sound alerts, chat, etc.)

## Downloading Pre-trained Models

If you want to skip the training step:

1. Check the project repository's Releases section for pre-trained models
2. Download the models and place them in this directory
3. Verify the models match the expected specifications

## Model Security

These models are trained on publicly available ASL datasets and do not contain:
- Personal user data
- Biometric information
- Proprietary content

They can be safely distributed with the application.

## Performance Notes

- **FP16 quantization** reduces model size by ~50% compared to FP32
- **GPU delegate** can be enabled for devices with GPU support
- **CPU delegate** works on all devices but may be slower
- **Edge TPU** provides fastest inference on supported devices

See `docs/MODEL_SETUP.md` for detailed conversion and optimization instructions.
