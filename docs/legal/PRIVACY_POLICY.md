# SignSync Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** 2026-01-06

This Privacy Policy explains how **SignSync** ("SignSync", "we", "us") processes information when you use the SignSync mobile application (the "App").

SignSync is designed to be **privacy-first**. Core features (ASL translation, object detection, and sound detection) are intended to run **on-device** and do **not** require uploading your camera feed or microphone audio to our servers.

## 1. Who we are

- **Product:** SignSync
- **Contact email:** support@signsync.app (replace with your official support contact for production)
- **Privacy contact:** privacy@signsync.app (recommended)

> If you are publishing SignSync commercially, update this section with your legal entity name and address.

## 2. Information we process

### 2.1 Camera
- **Purpose:** ASL sign translation, object detection.
- **Processing:** Camera frames are processed **locally on your device**.
- **Storage:** By default, camera frames are **not stored**.

### 2.2 Microphone
- **Purpose:** Sound detection and alerts; optional voice input.
- **Processing:** Audio is processed **locally on your device**.
- **Storage:** By default, raw microphone audio is **not stored**.

### 2.3 User content (optional)
Depending on features you enable, the App may store local content such as:
- Chat history (if you use the AI assistant)
- Settings and preferences
- Enrolled face profiles (if you enable face recognition features)

Unless explicitly stated in the App UI, this information is stored **locally on your device**.

### 2.4 Diagnostics and crash reports (optional)
The codebase supports optional error reporting (e.g., Sentry). Whether this data is collected depends on your release configuration and user consent.

If enabled, diagnostics may include:
- Device model and OS version
- App version
- Error stack traces
- Limited context to reproduce crashes

We recommend:
- **No default PII** in crash reports
- **User consent** for optional analytics/diagnostics

### 2.5 Analytics (optional)
Analytics is disabled by default in this codebase. If enabled in a production release, analytics may collect usage metrics (e.g., feature usage, session events). You must ensure appropriate notice and consent where required.

## 3. Legal bases (GDPR)
Where GDPR applies, we rely on:
- **Consent** for optional features (e.g., analytics, crash reporting where applicable)
- **Legitimate interests** to maintain and secure the App (only if applicable and balanced)
- **Contract** to provide the service where users request features

## 4. How we use information
We use information to:
- Provide on-device translation/detection features
- Save user preferences (theme, language, accessibility settings)
- Improve reliability (diagnostics/crash reporting if enabled)
- Provide optional AI functionality (if enabled and configured)

## 5. Data sharing
We do not sell your personal information.

We may share limited information with third parties only when:
- You enable optional integrations (e.g., crash reporting, analytics)
- You use third-party services (e.g., Google Gemini) and your request is sent to that provider

Third-party services are governed by their own privacy policies.

## 6. Data retention
- **On-device data:** retained until you delete it, uninstall the App, or use in-app wipe controls (if available).
- **Diagnostics:** retained according to the provider’s retention settings (configure for minimum needed).

## 7. Your rights
### 7.1 GDPR rights
You may have the right to:
- Access, correct, or delete personal data
- Object to or restrict processing
- Data portability
- Withdraw consent at any time (where processing is based on consent)

### 7.2 CCPA/CPRA (California) rights
You may have the right to:
- Know what personal information is collected and why
- Request deletion
- Opt out of sale/sharing (SignSync does not sell data)
- Non-discrimination for exercising rights

## 8. Security
We use reasonable technical measures to protect information, including:
- Secure local storage where applicable
- Encryption for sensitive local data (where implemented)
- Least-privilege access

No method of storage or transmission is 100% secure.

## 9. Children’s privacy
SignSync is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction). If you believe a child has provided personal information, contact us.

## 10. International transfers
If you enable cloud-based services (e.g., AI assistant), data may be processed in other countries depending on your service provider configuration.

## 11. Changes to this policy
We may update this Privacy Policy. We will post updates with a new effective date.
